# Employer-Set-Project-Mock-Example-
Employer Set Project (Mock Example)

This is an example of a project I have worked on as part of my T Level Course. This is one of two mock examples of the Employer Set Project that we completed in 2022. I do not have my final submitted Employer Set Project that was graded as part of my course, so this mock is what remains.

This includes a combination of python files that demonstrate an executable code, as well as word documents, excel spreadsheets and gantt charts, as the task required us to develop a project that included managing staff and team members, as well as producing an executable python file.

Each Task folder contains the following:
- Pre-Task - research on the industry and use of technology (notes)
- Task 1 - organisation of a project team, allocation of tasks (Gantt Chart, pricing plan, rationale)
- Task 2 - error and fault finding from a piece of code made by the exam board (example python file, test log)
- Task 3 -
- Task 4a - Finalised project file based on the sample design (python file, csv file to pull data from)
- Task 4b - evaluation.
