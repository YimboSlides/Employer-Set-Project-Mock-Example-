# Employer-Set-Project-Mock-Example-
Employer Set Project (Mock Example)

This is an example of a project I have worked on as part of my T Level Course. This is one of two mock examples of the Employer Set Project that we completed in 2022. I do not have my final submitted Employer Set Project that was graded as part of my course, so this mock is what is left.

This includes a combination of python files that demonstrate an executable code, as well as word documents, excel spreadsheets and gantt charts, as the task required us to develop a project that included managing staff and team members, as well as producing an executable python file.
